How to commit new releases:

1. Update version number in appveyor.yml.
2. Commit changes on Development branch.
3. Push outgoing changesets on Development branch.
4. Switch to Master branch.
5. Merge Development into Master branch.
6. Push outging changesets on Master branch.
7. Create tag on head of Master branch with the version number in format "v0.6.21".
8. From the Git Changes tab in Visual Studio select "Push all Tags to -> origin".

This should automatically create a new release in GitHub and a new Nuget package.

If there is a problem with deploying the Nuget packages:

- Log in into Nuget.org.
- Go to API keys in the personal menu.
- Under "Manage", regenerate API key.
- Copy key.
- Paste key in Appveyor under Settings\Deployment\API key in the Nuget deployment provider section.
- Go to export YAML.
- Copy secure key to local appveyor.yml
- Push changes
