How to commit new releases:

1. Update version number in appveyor.yml.
2. Commit changes on Development branch.
3. Push outgoing changes on Development branch.
4. Switch to Master branch.
5. Merge Development into Master branch.
6. Create tag on merged changeset of Master branch with the version number in format "v0.6.21".

This should automatically create a new release in GitHub and a new Nuget package.

If there is a problem with deploying the Nuget packages:

- Log in into Nuget.org.
- Go to API keys in the personal menu.
- Under "Manage", regenerate API key.
- Copy key.
- Paste key in Appveyor under Settings\Deployment\API key in the Nuget deployment provider section.
- Go to export YAML.
- Copy secure key to local appveyor.yml
- Push changes
