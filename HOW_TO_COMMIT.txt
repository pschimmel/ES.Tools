How to commit new releases:

1. Update version number in appveyor.yml.
2. Commit changes on Development branch.
3. Push outgoing changes on Development branch.
4. Switch to Master branch.
5. Merge Development into Master branch.
6. Create tag on merged changeset of Master branch with the version number in format "v0.6.21".

This should automatically create a new release in GitHub and a new Nuget package.
